Results of the prediction of client claims on auto insurance

This project writes a functional and structured code in python using a jupyter notebook. Data used are train_auto.csv and test_auto.csv. The project predicts client claims (target is TARGET_TAG) on auto insurance data. The completed code and submission predictions are found in this repository (https://github.com/gbangout/data-scientist-technical-test-result/tree/master). 

The notebook code are saved with output as: Auto_Insurance.ipynb
The predictions is in a csv file as "submission_logistic.csv" and contain the variables "index" and "p_target" (as suggestion in the kaggle competition)

Attention is made on:

returning the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric
explaining with markdown comment important modelling decisions including metric selection
generating a csv file with the predictions

Submission of the predictions on kaggle (gbangout) (https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017) give the following scores:

Public Score:  5298.47588

Private score: 4778.58827
