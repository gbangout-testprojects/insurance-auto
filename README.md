Results of the prediction of client claims on auto insurance


This project writes a functional and structured code in python using a jupyter notebook. Data used are train_auto.csv and test_auto.csv. The project predicts client claims (target is TARGET_TAG) on auto insurance data. The completed code and submission predictions are found in this repository. Notebooks are saved with output. 

Attention is made on:
returning the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric
explaining with markdown comment important modelling decisions including metric selection
generating a csv file with the predictions

Submission of the predictions on kaggle (gbangout) give the following scores:
Public Score:  5298.47588
Private score: 4778.58827
